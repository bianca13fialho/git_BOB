            <p>The Nightmares first appeared after the Happening, the destruction of Greendale made it clear that something was happening around the Ultimate Project and Atlas Project, they were silent and hid in the shadows at first, but eventually started making themselves known to the world.
                Now, the Nightmares are causing more destruction around the globe, and have finally revealed themsevles to the general public by the creation of the Killing Games.</p>

            <p>The Nightmares have a special hierarchy amongst themselves and their followers, it follows:
                - The Leader (1 known individual)
                - The general (1 known individual)
                - Terrors (13 known individuals)
                - Followers (100 known individuals)
                - Dreams (unknown)
                - Meat (unknown)
            </p>

It is good to know that he used to suffer from <b>[REDACTED]</b> Condition, that along with minor auditory hallucinations made him extremely dangerous. He was given full psychological treatment by Cassidy Ford, which helped him. We do not know his behaviour as a Terror, but if his condition returns, he could be dangerous to not only the world, but to the Nightmares.</p>
                    <p>He was given Light goggles, we don't understand how they work, but somehow they were able to invent a machine capable of absorbing all light waves and turning them into specific views, night vision, thermal vision and a dangerous one, laser vision.

                    <p>Grace always had an unresting and justice-seeking soul, she used her talents to move people for great causes, she was responsible for the end of Canadian deforestation, animal rights, human rights and more. The Leader having brainwashed her to his cause was the best move he could do, once he had someone with the talent to convince others it would be easy to have everyone else join. Unfortunately for the world, Grace was easy to manipulate.</p>
                    <p>Grace uses her talent to rile people up to summon crowds and cause chaos and civil unrest, she moves fast and unpredictably, she might be responsible for the fall of Cuba, revolutions of the southern-east Asia and several riots across the world. We also believe she was personally responsible for the assassinatios of over 50 world-leaders. As it was stated before, she is unpredictable and lethal, giving her a TL of 5.</p>

                    <p>After joining the Nightmares, Jade's personality didn't change like the others, probably because she either did not have a personality or she would always be acting. She has not been involved in attacks directly, she is the Nightmares main messenger, giving messages virtually or in real life. She personally came to two of OMFI installations to discuss diplomacy with heads of departments, once she appeared as <i>Willy Wonka</i> and another time as <i>Marilyn Monroe</i>.</p>

                    <p>From the moment we summoned Lara, we knew she was different, she wore a huge hood with a long cape and spoke as if she was an ancient viking, even sharing the same mythological beliefs. Eventually, that faded away, releaving her genious self. She had an actual job in a hospital where she lived, she was locally known as a magical kid doctor who cured many people and saved countless lives, she was even trained in surgeries, having done three herself before. As far as we know, she only had 1 patient die under her care, which haunts her to this day.</p>
                    <p>She mainly operates as the medic of the Nightmares, healing them from any wounds of their missions, she also works in the background, along with Emma, to find scientific support for them. She also sometimes operates on the field, going on attacks, always on top of a pale horse and her crossbow on her back. Thanks to our informant, we know that she is trying to make the perfect virus, we do not know why, but this is possibly dangerous if they plan on releasing the virus on the wild.</p>

                    <p>Nicole started the school as a normal high school student, she was probably the most normal of them all, even thought she had previous fame from her position on her dad's company and popularity on social medias. She had an attraction to gossip and aesthetics, which is normal for a girl her age. Her involvement with the Leader makes sense, mainly because of her curiosity.</p>
                    <p>Nicole is another complicated Terror, she acts as support and agent for the Nightmares. She frequently goes out on missions, but we do know she is the main creator of their outfits. Somehow, she was able to sewn Emmorium into cloth to make incredibly resistant and possibly bulletproof clothes. As a field agent, Nicole is very violent and brutal, she is not good at fighting but she does have several weapons at her disposal, she should not be treated like a minor threat.</p>

                    <p>Zaria is the young queen of the kingdom of Iswera, a small town in Ethiopia looking for independence. Zaria was married to the King at a young age, but that didn't stop her from reaching her goals, she managed to ban child marriages and completely end violence, hunger and other issues on her kingdom and surrounding area. He association with the Leader was extremely lethal, having an actual queen under his brainwash was the strongest move on his part.</p>
                    <p>After becoming a Nightmare, Zaria quickly moved back to her kingdom, had the king assassinated, and took over the power, she quickly started her moves, taking over surrounding towns either diplomatically or violently. As of now, she has complete control of east and north-east Africa, including Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and she began her moves on Egypt. This area is completely cut off from the world, but we do have knowledge that she is operating as a good queen, but a ruthless dictator.</p>

            <p>We believe that the Nightmares, under the order of Andrey Jakov, are planning to steal and use a Tsar Bomb, previously believed to not exist.

                    <p>Luca used the stolen identity of Wolfgang Berger (Ultimate Mountaineer) to get into the school, we had no idea. He was the head of the Leone Family, the biggest Italian mafia of modern times. He was great at acting normally and none of us knew his real identity. It is interesting that the Leader never got involved with him, and yet, Luca followed his classmates on the Nightmare cult.</p>
                    <p>After a failed assassination attempt, Luca was caught by local Italian authorities, in a month he caused a riot and sold himself to us. He refuses to give intel on himself, but he has proven to be extremely helpful on selling out the other Nightmares.</p>
                    <p><b>Containment:</b> Luca has been contained on a 20x20 feet tempered glass cell on level 7 of base-10. He was provided with a bed, table, toilet and a swing.</p>
