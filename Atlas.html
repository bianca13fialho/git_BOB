            <h1>Project Atlas</h1>
            <h3>Our intent when building the school was never truly revealed, we came to <b>[ERROR]</b></h3>
            <h3>The U.N. got suspicious, they wanted to investigate. Eleanor had an idea, from her father's files, she came up with Atlas</h3>
            <h3>To complete our goal, we had to completely abandon everything we believed in, twenty four of our scientists quit in the process</h3>
            <h3>It was supposed to be a good thing, the end was supposed to justify the means</h3>
            <h3>He stole <i>It</i> from us</h3>
            <h3>I regret working on <i>It</i>, if there is a God, I hope he'll be able to forgive us</h3>

            <p>With our combined knowledge on the field of Ultimates, we were able to determine the source of their talents. "Area 42."</p>
            <p>Average talented people tend to display their talent all over the brain, as it was shown by MRI scans. However, on young Ultimates, Area 42 showed increased signs of activity upon talent activation.</p>

                <p><b>Experiment:</b> Source of talent.</p>
                <p><b>Test:</b> Student was provided a computer and given the task to write a complicated code.</p>
                <p>The MRI scanner invented by <b>[REDACTED]</b> was placed on the Student's head. She followed the instructions with minor distractions, she would ocasionally make some off-handed references to obscure 80's movies.</p>
                <p><b>Results:</b> Area 42 displayed high activity.</p>

            <p>After months of experimentation and a breakthrough by our neurosurgeon, we managed to develop a machine capable of stimulating and mapping neurological systems, he named the machine "Metis."</p>
            <p>We found that by shooting a small laser-acurate beam of ion-charged electromagnetic particles on specific areas of the brain we could activate them. On that basis, Metis was created, to map and pinpoint the neurons we choose to activate.</p>
            <p>This was done with the intent to produce artificial talent.</p>

                <p><b>Test:</b> The Subject was placed on a comfortable room and given a wide arrange of color-coded buttons, each played a different note.</p>
                <p>By using Metis, Dr. Kellig found that the place where Area 42 was supposed to be was empty, after a small charge of electromagnetic particles the test began. The Subject was given food, shelter, entertainment and the buttons. After twelve hours, the Subject began exploring the buttons and their sounds.
                   An hour later, the subject had started composing a full baroque sheet music.</p>
                <p><b>Results:</b> A full sheet of music, the style was similar to that of Bach's.</p>

            <p>After the success of the previous experiment, Director Alexander Knott provided us with all the funds and resources. It was at this time the U.N. began their investigations. Previous Director Eleanor Knott provided them with a small glimpse of our experiments, temporarily lowering their suspiciouns.</p>
            <p>We needed to step up the experiments, we had to know if humans could gain artificial talents like the rat, which is why we took in the teenage boy <b>[REDACTED]</b> Vaz. He had shown great interest in the school, being seen by Agent Houston several times observing the campus. He received an invitation and accepted instantly.</p>
            <p>Our experiments were explained to him, with minor hidden information, he showed great interest in receiving a talent, so we continued.</p>

                <p><b>Experiment:</b> Produce talent on human Subject.</p>
                <p><b>Test:</b> The Subject was placed on a pod connected to the MRI machine and Metis. The suspension pod was filled with amniotic fluid, he was also provided the required nutrients and oxygen.</p>
                <p>The experiment never came to a full conclusion. Subject was placed on the pod with the MRI and Metis on his head, after localizing Area 42, which was also empty, the charge of electromagnetic particles began. However, we did not account for the ammount of ions required to create a new Area 42 on a human mind.</p>
                <p>When the charges went up to 50%, Eleanor ordered Dr. Kellig to stop the machine, Director Knott disagreed and ordered for him to continue, Dr. Kellig had to obey Director Knott and continued on with the experiment. Once the machine reached 100%, Metis accidentaly released a full charged, filling the pod with electromagnetic particles and breaking the scanner.</p>
                <p>The Subject was removed from the pod. He was stuck on a coma for four days, when he woke up, the terrifying truth was revealed.</p>
                <p><b>Results:</b> The Subject's entire personality was erased, MRI scans revealed that Area 42 was created, however, it was 12 times bigger than normal. Since then, Subject displayed increased talent on all fields, we theorize he has acquired all Ultimate talents.</p>

            <p>Atlas Project was titled a failure. The Subject's entire existence was ordered to be erased, but we could not proceed.</p>
            <p>A few months after the creation of Atlas, our laboratory was raided by two unknown individuals, The Leader and a second male, it is believed that they had inside help, either from a Student of from Staff.</p>
            <p>The Leader knew exactly where to go. The doors to Atlas' room were locked by a retinal scanner, this was no problem to The Leader since during his raid his partner killed Agent Lee and removed his eye, using tha
