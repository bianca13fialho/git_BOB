            <h1>About:</h1>
            <p>Lewis Hood is the current Head of Central Intelligence, rising to this post from an intelligence asset. Lewis was hired to OMFI at 02/03/19, being personally recommended by Grey Müller (DECEASED), the previous leader of the Chemical Science Department. Lewis had previous connections to the Ultimate Academy for the Prodigy Youth, being invited by the head teacher Helena Winters (U-Teacher) to serve as a technician. Lewis worked at the academy for eight months along the other employees, with the help of Jonas Munoz (U-Neurosurgeon) and Mariah Schmid (U-Psychologist), Lewis managed to develop the Tri-Neuron Scanner, a machine capable of mapping the entire network of neurons in the human brain. That technology was lost and presumably stolen by the Nightmares. Lewis is among the other staff who disappeared at the night which concluded the Happening.</p>
            <h1>Family:</h1>
            <p>Anna Hood is Lewis' twin sister, she was also hired to work at OMFI. Lewis has no other living relatives.</p>
            <h1>Skills:</h1>
            <p>U-Talent - Lewis' Ultimate-level talent gives him the skill to deal with complicated machinery, he seems to be better at dealing with hardware (thanks to this knowledge, Houston paired him up with Aime Dashiki).</p>

                <P class="footerfont">Lewis is a loyal employee and useful informant. He is one of 26 survivors from the tragedy of the Happening, he feels strongly about OMFI's job and wants to do everything to stop the Nightmares, even if he can't. He has blind faith in destiny and seems to trust people easily, which could be confused with naiveness.</P>
