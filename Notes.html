            <h3><b>02/07/20</b></h3>
            <p>The day when the games began. It started off as a normal boring day, not much was happening on the news. But suddenly at <i>20:02</i> PM all television devices displayed what appeared to be emergency broadcasts or no signal messages.</p>
            <p>After 20 minutes of confusion everything was cleared out as devices started showing an image of a fox in a fancy room, the fox called itself "Vulpe<a href="#footnote-1" data-title="1. A half-white half-orange fox plushie that acts as the host for the games" data-footnote="[1]"></a>" and started acting as a host of a reality show, presenting the story, settings and location.</p>
            <p>As the host spoke, people started freaking out and stormed to social media, all trending tabs on Twitter were occupied by this event. It soon became obvious that someone had hijacked the airwaves, but nobody knew the extent of it.</p>
            <p>After presenting everything, there was a pause, enough time for people to realize how far this was. Reports of the event were coming from the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Russia, China, Egypt, the whole world was watching the exact same thing.</p>
            <p>Police stations were flooded with reports all over the world, everyone was going crazy, the world stopped to turn on their televisions and watch. Most people believed that it was a random terrorist attack and that it would be solved quickly, but it wasn't.</p>

            <pawns>
                <img src="Imagens/Characters.png" width="300">
                <figcaption>Participants pixelarts</figcaption>
            </pawns>

            <p>Vulpe returned to the screen and started introducing the world to the cast, now known as "Pawns". An image showed pixelarts for every participant of the games. A video started playing, it showed every participant going over to a camera and talking about their lives.</p>
            <p>It was after everyone was introduced and Vulpe finished talking that the games began, it started by showing every participant in a garden in the island. They were talking to Vulpe and the bunny, Bure<a href="#footnote-2" data-title="2. A half-white half-grey bunny plushie, she's the secondary host" data-footnote="[2]"></a>. The rules were explained and Bure was killed as an example. That's when it started.</p>

            <br>

            <h3><b>03/07/20</b></h3>
            <p>The first days were chaotic, riots broke out, there were protests, people hoarding resources and hiding in their bunkers all over the world. As some people took this attack as the beggining of the apocalypse, others continued with their lives just avoiding televisions. Nobody was turning on their TV's, nobody wanted to participate in this event. But the people that kept watching realized that whatever this was, it looked a lot like Big Brother.</p>
            <p>Law enforcement and military were overwhelmed by calls and people who wanted the trasmission to stop, but it didn't matter what they did, nothing worked. At <i>12:38</i> OMFI member <b>[REDACTED]</b> was taken to the <b>CBS Broadcast Center</b> in New York to attempt an interruption of the broadcast. Like other broadcast studios world-wide, this one had been live transmitting the killing games for the majority of the USA East coast.</p>
            <p>Agent <b>[REDACTED]</b> tried to turn off the broadcast in all available methods. After two (2) hours, he managed to disrupt the broadcast. Unfortunately, this attempt only lasted for <i>1:25</i> minutes before resuming into the live killing games. Other agents reported that in that time, six (6) channels were interrupted.</p>

                <figcaption>Broadcast interrupted</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>It was at that moment OMFI administration decided to alter the priority of actions, at first it was stopping the global broadcast, but when that revealed itself to be harder than expected, they decided to locate and stop the games from happening. But first, they had to locate the island. Meanwhile, the person, or people, behind the killing games had to rush their plans.</p>

            <br>

            <h3><b>04/07/20</b></h3>
            <p>At <i>08:30</i> AM, the participants <b>(To be refered as "Pawns"<a href="#footnote-3" data-title="3. Pawns are a reference to chess where the most expendable pieces are in the front" data-footnote="[3]"></a>)</b> were given giftboxes with hunting knives in them, as a way to motivate the killings. And at <i>10:45</i> AM, the Pawns were summoned to the lobby of the Nightmare Hotel, where they were given their first of many motives. Videos of their deepest darkest secrets were shared at random. Though reluctant, they knew this could be enough to cause some discord.</p>
            <P>Meanwhile, OMFI agents were rushing to locate the island to try and stop the killing games. And I should apologize for this, but I need to break the third person narration of events... Two days prior I had noticed that the administration of OMFI seemed nervous and guilty, much like Houston's own security task force and some engineers, it was revealed to us at <i>18:19</i> PM that the admins already knew the location of the island, and that secret mission was taking place two months ago, they were the ones who developed the dome.</P>
            <p>Below is the transcript of my interview with Agent Houston, 2nd branch leader, of OMFI:</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Interview 01: Houston</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Agent Houston: Alright, I know you're doing some notes about this whole thing, but is an interview necessary?<br/>
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b>: Of course, we need all the info we can get.<br/>
                    Agent Houston: Hmm...<br/>
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b>: Perfect... So, did you know about the "Protection Program"?<br/>
                    Agent Houston: Nope. Not a bit.<br/>
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b>: Did you know about Alex's involvement with the program?<br/>
                    Agent Houston: Can you...? No. I don't know anything about Alex, nor do I care. You know they're taking us there tomorrow, right? Maybe you can get your answers there.<br />
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b>: Don't change the subject.<br/>
                    Agent Houston: Subject... We're trying to stop whoever did this, what are you doing? Asking questions? Writing notes? You're all the same...
                    <em>At this point Agent Houston became agitated and left the interview.</em><br/>
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b>: This interview is over. I think he knows more than he's letting on, he was definetly involved in it somehow, but asking him is just going to make things worse, I should be careful, we never know when we could be fired or who we can trust...</p>
            </div>

            <p>After the interview, the location of the island was disclosed. The killing games were taking place in Coral Island<a href="#footnote-4" data-title="4. It is still unknown if the island already existed before 2018" data-footnote="[4]"></a> at <i>18.256456, -62.720219</i> just east of Anguilla. <b>(It should be noted that the island doesn't seem to appear in any satelite images or maps.)</b></p>

            <br>

            <h3><b>05/07/20</b></h3>
            <p>Some OMFI troops were moved to a secondary island next to Coral Island, Outpost-13<a href="#footnote-5" data-title="5. OMFI has a total of 25 Outposts located all over the globe" data-footnote="[5]"></a> was set up right next to the dome and observation stations were placed in all sides of the dome. The dome occupied an area of 500 feet radius, covering the entire Coral Island, the Outpost-13 island and third smaller island inside.</p>

            <pawns>
                <img src="Imagens/DomePlants.jpg" width="300">
                <figcaption>Dome blueprints</figcaption>
            </pawns>

            <p>Blueprints for the giant dome were disclosed, they had been created by <b>[REDACTED]</b>, Unfortunately, his body was found shortly after the ending of The Happening<a href="#footnote-6" data-title="6. Happening is the official name given to the weird events in the town of Greendale from 2018 to its destruction" data-footnote="[6]"></a>.</p>
            <p>It was only at <i>09:53</i> AM that we were notified of what had occured inside the dome. <b>[REDACTED]</b>'s body was found, she was stabbed overnight in her bedroom. The news came as a shock to everyone, not just in Outpost-13, but all over the world. Her name isntantly started tranding on Twitter, it was all everyone talked about. Suddenly, televisions were being turned on, people were finally interested in the killing games.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that wouldn't be the only casualty of the day. At <i>11:02</i> AM, as Vulpe was explaining what would happen now that the killing games had started, <b>[REDACTED]</b> broke one of the most important rules, attacking Vulpe. This prompted Vulpe to activate his defense robot which shot several darts at <b>[REDACTED]</b>. He would've died if it wasn't for <b>[REDACTED]</b> pushing him out of the way, taking all the darts and dying in his place.</p>
            <p>After this series of unfortunate events, the Pawns were ordered to investigate the crime scene and the investigation section of the games began. They would come to an end at <i>16:16</i> PM, when Vulpe called everyone to the beach of the island, they got on a yacht which drove itself to the "Trial Island", not before Bure returned from her death in a pink drone. That island was divided in two, one half housed the Trial Room, a small circular structure with a glass ceiling, and the other half housed Outpost-13.</p>
            <p>As the Pawns stepped into the Trial Room, the drone-mounted camera entered through a window, finally showing the outside world what it looked like, a circular room with twenty (20) podiums organized in a circle, two (2) of them had grey photos of the deceased Pawns. The Pawns went to their respective podiums, Vulpe and Bure's plushies were placed in a scale mounted on a sword, a demented symbol of justice.</p>
            <p>The trial started and the broadcast changed, cameras weren't stable anymore, they were dinamic, flying around the room, spinning and rotating. Bits of information were edited into the footage and they were even doing flashbacks with old recordings, whoever was editing the footage, they were doing a great job at it. The trial lasted for three (3) hours before the Panws reached a verdict, <b>[REDACTED]</b> was found guilty of the murder. And as Vulpe announced that the verdict was correct, the broadcast showed everything that happened during that night.</p>
            <p>After giving his final words, <b>[REDACTED]</b> was dragged out of the room into a separate space where he was executed live for the world to see. That event made everyone realize the truth, this wasn't just a prank or a hoax, this was real, someone hijacked the airwaves to display killing games, and it all went downhill after this.</p>

            <br>

            <h3><b>Incident logs:</b></h3>
            <p>Our stay in Outpost-13 was not met with peace, as dome defense sentries attacked OMFI agents every time they could. Here is displayed some incident logs of these past two days.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Incident log: 01</button>

                </incident>
                <p>Oupost-13 development wasn't easy, OMFI sent seven (7) level 5 helicopters, five (5) level 4 helicopters, two (2) support helicopters and ten (10) level 1 helicopters. In total twenty-four (24) helicopters were deployed with agents, resourcers and tools, out of them, thirteen (13) were shot down by Dome Protection Sentries.</p>
                <p>DPS were developed alongside the dome, in total there are one hundred and twelve (112) DPS covering the entire perimeter of the dome, they were also hacked by the organizers of the games.</p>
                <p><b>Personal note:</b> It appears that whoever is behind this horrendous crime loves to use symbolism and irony, they love to use our weapons against us. Whoever they are, they have a lovely sense of humour...</p>

                </incident>
                <p>As the nights were often boring since all Pawns were asleep, Vulpe would do a four (4) hour long monologue every night, he would present previous events of the game, add surveys for the viewers and even broadcast scripted ad breaks. OMFI agents were told to watch the entire broadcast day and night in oscilating shift, after all Vulpe could put a clue somewhere.</p>
                <p>Suddenly at <i>03:33</i> AM of <b>05/07/18</b>, in order to distract our troops, Vulpe displayed a peculiar message during an ad break, it read: <b>Would you. Could you. On a train?</b>. An excerpt from a Dr. Seuss book. It was imitating a previous incident of the 2016 Hoboken train crash at <b>29/9/16</b>. Agents were deployed in train stations all over the world to monitor the situation, fortunately, that was just a lie from Vulpe.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>When the organizers of the games realized OMFI had settled on the nearby island, someone decided to contact us. Here is an excerpt from the conversation this unknown individual had with Agent Lewis:</p>
                <hr />
                <h3><b>05/07/18</b></h3>
                <h3><i>13:00</i></h3>
                <p>???: I understand your concerns, but there's nothing for you here.<br>
                    Agent Lewis: I doubt that. You hacked into our systems, stole our protection device, trapped an entire classroom of kids and told them to kill each other live for the world to see.<br>
                    ???: Like I said, nothing for you.<br>
                    Agent Lewis: We want to stop you, that's all. End the games.<br>
                    ???: You can't just simply end them... You don't get it, do you? These games have been happening for hundreds of years. This is just another stage of it.<br>
                    Agent Lewis: Who are you?<br>
                    ???: I am... Anyone... And everyone. I am an idea that you all have burried deep down in your souls but that few have the guts to face. I can't be stopped, not now at least.<br>
                    Agent Lewis: How did you do this?<br>
                    ???: Oh please, this isn't an interview...<br>
                    Agent Lewis: Then why did you contact us?<br>
                    ???: For this...</p>
                <h3>At this point of the conversation, one of the DPS surfaced from the dome and shot at the edge of the island.</h3>
                <p>???: This is just a warning, leave me and my world alone, we don't want any trouble... Yet.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>The conversation ended abruptly, the person's voice was also modified making it impossible to identify the source.</p>
