            <h3>Some intel:</h3>
            <p>At <b>02/07/20</b>, <i>20:02</i> PM, an event shook the world, all television and radio airwaves were hijacked by unknown individuals and some sort of distorted reality show started being broadcast. This show entitled "Objective: Fear" had 20 young kids trapped on an island resort inside a dome, the host, a fox plushie named Vulpe, explained the rules of the game and that the only way to win and escape was to kill someone and get away with it. This kickstarted a global event "The World's Nightmare".</p>
            <p>The show is live 24/7 on every channel and some radio frequencies. All attempts of ending the broadcast have proven themselves ineffective, OMFI's last resort is to forcefully remove the kids from the island.</p>
            <p>The rules of the game are: </br>
                #1: Students are required to live at the island for the remainder of the unforeseeable future.</br>
#2: When a murder is committed in the island, a Class Trial will be conducted. Participation in this trial is mandatory for all surviving students.</br>
#3: A maximum of two murders can occur during each turn of the killing game.</br>
#4: If the killer is correctly identified during the Class Trial, only the culprit will be punished for their crime.</br>
#5: If the culprit cannot be identified, or if an incorrect student is identified as the culprit, all students except the culprit will be punished for the crime.</br>
#6: If the culprit survives the Class Trial, they are declared the winner. At which point, they will get to leave the island.</br>
#7: "Nighttime" is officially designated as the hours between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. During this time, the dining hall and kitchen are closed.</br>
#8: All acts of violence toward Vulpe, the headmaster, are strictly prohibited. In addition, grabbing or moving the Vulpe plushies is considered violence.</br>
#9: Do not destroy island property, that includes cameras, screens, windows, doors and robots.</br>
#10: Vulpe will never directly participate in a murder.</br>
#11: Your Vulpads are very important items. Make sure you do not damage them.</br>
#12: Students who violate these rules will be killed by the giant spider or one of the many drones (they have cameras and guns).</br>
#13: Any more rules can be added if needed.

            <div class="content">
                <h3>These are their mascots:</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="Imagens/Vulpe.png" width="300">
                <figcaption>Vulpe</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A fox plushie, divided in half by two colors, orange on the left and white on the right. One of its eyes is a red crescent moon with a sharp tear, a symbol we have titled "Nightmare". This symbol was first seen during the Happening and the destruction of Greendale.</p>
            <p>There appears to be a microphone and a camera inside the plushie, that's how he is able to communicate with the participants. Vulpe also appears to posses some sort of touch detection device as he was able to feel when <b>[̶F̶r̶a̶n̶c̶i̶n̶e]</b> F-07 slightly touched him on the back.</p>
            <p>Vulpe acts as some sort of host for the games, he might also be a surrogate for the mastermind but it is unknown whether the person speaking through Vulpe is the creator of the games or just an accomplice. The location of that individual is also unknown, current theories list him as being inside the dome with the Pawns.</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

            <br clear="both">

            </figure>
            <p>A bunny plushie, divided in half by two colors, grey on the left and white on the right. One of its eyes is a reversed satelite, this symbol has been entitled "Dream" and has also been spotted in the city of Greendale during the Happening. Bure also appears to have a blue bowtie with red strikes.</p>
            <p>Its function is seemingly identical to Vulpe, although her alignments seem to diverge from Vulpe's, where he motivates the participants to kill one another, she actively tries to avoid any discord and casualties. Whenever she appears is to bring a gift or good news to the Pawns, this could also just be another way of inspiring fear and despair by giving and taking hope.</p>
            <p>It is unknown whether or not she has the same intents as Vulpe, but she shouldn't be trusted.</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

                <figcaption>Giant robot spider</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We do not have information on this entity, all we know is from watching the live footage of the games. The giant robot spider (GRS for short) seems to be a security robot or a punishment ensurer, acting as a defense mechanism for the other mascots and a deadly tool if necessary.</p>
            <p>There are no available images of the GRS or its blueprints, therefore we should give a brief description of it. GRS is a 10 foot tall robot constructed from electronic circuitry, high-strength polymer impregnated with carbon nanotubes, copper shielding, Emmorium reinvestment and a white comestic face mask. GRS sustains itself on six long metal legs and two arms. The arms have claws to grab and two legs are equipped with blades. GRS has shown three different weapons but it's unclear if it has more.</p>
            <p>GRS is hostile towards anyone who breaks one of the game rules set by Vulpe, having already killed <b>[REDACTED]</b>.</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

                <h3>The island in which the games are taking place:</h3>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Coral Island</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Pawns were taken to Coral Island at 18.256456, -62.720219, just east of Anguilla, by the "Protection Program", an underground OMFI mission to take the kids of the "Dis High School" and secure them on an island after threats, they were supposed to stay in the island and the dome to protect them from... Something.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the resort and the island didn't exist until a year ago and no records of its construction are available, as far as we know, it suddenly appeared in the middle of the ocean. The island was chosen by the program for unknown reasons.</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

            <h3>Plants of the biodome installed around the island:</h3>

                <figcaption>Biodome plants</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Biodomes were invented by <b>[REDACTED]</b> before his death. He used to be a head engineer of the 6th OMFI division, he didn't have any contact with terrorist threats as far as internal investigations teams know so he was most likely not corrupt. His body was found with a bullet-wound on his head, the scene looked like a suicide since a revolver was on his right hand, but this is strange considering he was left-handed.</p>
            <p>The intent of the dome was to protect the kids in the island in a last resort, but the safeguards of the dome were hacked at <b>02/07/20</b> locking the kids inside the island.</p>
            <p>The domes are constructed of titanium, copper, iron and Emmorium, the interior of the dome is covered with high-definition screens. The exterior of the dome is covered with hidden DPS (Drone Protection Sentries), these weapons are automatic and are used to shoot down any threats approaching the dome.</p>
