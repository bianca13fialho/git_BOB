            <h3>These are their mascots:</h3>
            
            <p>A fox plushie, divided in half by two colors, orange and white. One of its eyes is a red crescent moon with a sharp tear</p>
            <p>There appears to be a microphone and a camera inside the plushie, that's how he was able to communicate with the participants</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

            <br clear="both">

            <p>A bunny plushie, divided in half by two colors, grey and white. One of its eyes is a reverse satelite</p>
            <p>Its function is seemingly identical to Vulpe, although her alignments seem to diverge from Vulpe's, where he motivates the participants to kill one another, she actively tries to avoid it</p>
            <p>It is unknown whether or not she has the same intents as Vulpe, but she shouldn't be trusted</p>

            <br clear="both">

            <h3>The island in which the games are taking place:</h3>
            
            <p>The island is located in the Caribbean, somewhere around Grenada</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the resort didn't exist until a year ago and no records of its construction are available, as far as we know, it suddenly appeared</p>
            <p>Any more discoveries and updates TBA</p>

            <br clear="both">

            <h3>Plants of the biodome installed around the island:</h3>
            
            <p>Biodomes were invented by <b>[REDACTED]</b> before his death</p>
            <p>The intent was to protect the kids in the island, but the process was also hacked and manually activated by the kidnappers</p>
